# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```

A great advantage of this visualization is that everything is presented in a very clear and simple manner, despite the fact that a large amount of information is analyzed - more than 12 parameters.
 Six key parameters are placed at the top and are easy to read - the font is large enough. The color scheme is contrast, but not irritating - easy to perceive.
 The names of key parameters in relation to the previous period are indicated next to each other and are highlighted in the green or red font color, depending on the growth or decline -that is quite easy to read and useful for understanding. 
 An interactive map has been added to the set of graphs, in which you can select a particular region and see the corresponding parameters for this region or a particular city â€“ that is very convenient to use, and can expand a lot of additional information.

      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      
For Good example:
     What should be improved is that there is no campaign name in the headline and there are no scales with absolute numbers - probably a document for use within the company and users know what it is about, but it is still worth including this information.
The Diversity by gender and race graph is not entirely clear without numbers â€“ it is necessary to add this information.
 It is also worth adding data on the dynamics for a longer period, because only 2 years are included, and it is not entirely clear how important or critical the changes are in the long term.







      
      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)

### Why am I doing this assignment?:

- This assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses the learning outcomes
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story
